/*

the first intent is to be able to link all events from the same user via some common identifier. rudder data payload contains two fields anonymous_id and user_id. the first is device specific and generated by the rudder sdk, the second is the user identifier that can be assigned by application code depending on a userâ€™s registration or login.

typically a user would login to an application at least once while using the application on a particular device. the user_id should then become available and be included in event messages. below code creates a unique identifier dbt_visitor_id that links the user_id to the anonymous_id. the analytic function first_value has been used here
